<div>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The categories list contains the names of categories you can assign to recipes.
  <br/>The <b>Manage Categories</b> form allows you to add/remove/change entries in your categories list.<br/>
  The fields and buttons are:
  
  <app-about-heading fIcon="assessment" fText="Category Name" fIconColor="app-active-input-icon-color"></app-about-heading>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the name for the category.
  From the drop-down list, select a category to change/remove it or select <b>New Category Name</b> to add
  a new category name to the list.

  <app-about-heading fIcon="edit" fText="Existing Category Name" fIconColor="app-active-input-icon-color"></app-about-heading>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;This icon will display next to the input field if you choose an exitsig category from the 
  list in the Category Name field. Edit or delete this category name.

  <app-about-heading fIcon="add_circle_outline" fText="New Category Name" fIconColor="app-active-input-icon-color"></app-about-heading>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;This icon will display next to the input field if you choose New Category Name from 
  the list in the Category Name field. Enter a name for the new category here.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;You can create as many category names as you like and it is usually best to create names
  that allow you to have a family structure to your categories. Broad categories like Appetizer, Entre, Dessert,
  etc. are a good starting point. Categories like Meat could be a category you always include with more
  specific categories like Chicken, Beef, Pork and Lamb. Remember, when you specify categories in a Search, 
  ALL categories specified must be present on the recipe for it to be a 'match'.  The more thought you put
  into the organization of your categories the easier it will be to quickly find just the recipes you want.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as an option, you can create a category that represents you like, 'Julie R. Jacobson', that you can 
  attach to recipes you share.  This way, other users can easily find recipes you have contributed by searching for 
  recipes that have that category.
