  <div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>Add Shared Recipe</b> form allows you share a recipe with other users.<br/>
    The fields and buttons are:
    
    <app-about-heading fIcon="mail_outline" fText="Authorized Users" fIconColor="app-active-input-icon-color"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an optional list that you can create to control who sees the
    shared version of this recipe. The list
    contains email addresses associated with the accounts of other <i><b>MyRecipeMongo</b></i> users that you
    want to share this recipe with. Leave this list empty to share with all users.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;From the drop-down list, select an email address to change/remove or select <b>New Authorized User</b>
    to add a new email address to the list.

    <app-about-heading fButton="Cancel"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This button cancels sharing the recipe.

    <app-about-heading fButton="Share"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the recipe shared and/or saves the Authorized Users List if any.

    <app-about-heading fIcon="warning" fText="Tips and Warnings" fIconColor="app-checkbox" [fDivider]="true"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you create an Authorized Users list, only those users and you will be able to see the 
    shared version of this recipe.
