  <div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>Add Shared Recipe</b> form allows you to make a Shared copy of the selected recipe.<br/>
    The fields and buttons are:
    
    <app-about-heading fIcon="mail_outline" fText="Authorized Users" fIconColor="app-active-input-icon-color"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an optional list that you can create to control who has access to the
    Shared recipe. The list
    contains email addresses that are associated with the accounts of other <i><b>MyRecipeMongo</b></i> users that you
    want to give access to this recipe. Leave this list empty to allow access to all users.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;From the drop-down list, select an email address to change/remove or select <b>New Authorized User</b>
    to add a new email address to the list.

    <app-about-heading fButton="Cancel"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This button cancels making the Shared copy.

    <app-about-heading fButton="Share"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This button creates the Shared copy of the recipe and saves the Authorized Users List if any.

    <app-about-heading fIcon="warning" fText="Tips and Warnings" fIconColor="app-checkbox" [fDivider]="true"></app-about-heading>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you create an Authorized Users list, only those users and you will be able to view the 
    Shared copy of this recipe.
